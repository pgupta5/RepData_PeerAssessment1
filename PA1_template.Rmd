## Loading and preprocessing the data
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date)

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
StepsPerDay <- aggregate(activity$steps, list(activity$date), FUN=sum)
colnames(StepsPerDay) <- c("Date", "Steps")
paste("Mean Steps per Day =", mean(StepsPerDay$Steps, na.rm=TRUE))

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
StepsAvgPerDay <- aggregate(activity$steps, list(activity$date), FUN=mean,na.action=na.omit)
colnames(StepsAvgPerDay) <- c("Date", "Steps")
stepsTimeSeries <- ts(StepsAvgPerDay$Steps)
plot.ts(StepsAvgPerDay$Steps)

## Imputing missing values
activity$steps<- ifelse(is.na(activity$steps), 
                                  mean(activity$steps, na.rm=TRUE), 
                                  activity$steps)

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
